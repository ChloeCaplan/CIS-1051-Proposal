## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

I will include visual pictures of Temple buildings, people, etc. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to have a completed, well-functioning interactive game that will show upcoming Temple freshman what it's like to be a Temple student. For the best possible option, I hope to include many important places from Temple's history. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I will need to learn Ren'Py as well as incorporating pictures into a python program. I will also need to research important places to include in my game.
